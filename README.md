# Weather

A web application that allows users to search for and see weather conditions for different places (e.g. addresses, cities, ZIP codes) and save those places to a viewable list.

## Why I Built This

In building this web application, my goal was to provide users with a convenient and intuitive way to access weather information for various locations. By enabling users to search for weather conditions based on addresses, cities, and ZIP codes, I aimed to simplify the process of staying informed about weather forecasts. Additionally, the ability to save favorite places and create a personalized list adds a practical touch, allowing users to quickly access weather updates for their frequently visited locations.
